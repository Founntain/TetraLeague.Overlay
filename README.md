# TetraLeague Overlay

A simple overlay for displaying your Tetra League (TL) stats in OBS using a Browser Source. You can choose to display your stats as a static image or a live view that updates every 60 seconds.

If you find this overlay useful, please consider giving it a ⭐ to show your support, or share it with others who might enjoy it. Thank you for using it!

## 🎖️ Usage

To use the overlay, simply use one of the following URLs:

- **Live View** (auto-updates every 60 seconds): `https://tetrio.founntain.dev/tetraleague/stats/<username>/web`
- **Static Image**: `https://tetrio.founntain.dev/tetraleague/stats/<username>`

### 📽️ OBS Setup

For OBS, it is recommended to use the live view URL. To set it up:

1. Create a new Browser Source in OBS.
2. Paste the live view URL into the Browser Source settings, replacing `<username>` with your Tetr.io username (make sure to remove the `<` and `>`).
3. Make sure the widht and height is **900 x 300**

> **Note:** Ensure you use the URL ending with `/web` for live updates. The data is cached and refreshes every 60 seconds. Tetra League data is cached for 5 minutes, so the maximum delay before updates is approximately 6 minutes.

### 🛠️ Customization Parameters

- **`backgroundColor`**: Adjusts the background color (useful if you don’t want a transparent background). Default is `00FFFFFF`.
- **`textColor`**: Changes the text color and the color of the progress bar. Default is `FFFFFF`.

> **Example:** `https://tetrio.founntain.dev/tetraleague/stats/<username>/web?backgroundColor=FF0000&textColor=00FF00`
